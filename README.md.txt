# Enhancing Wellness Through Effective Breathing  

## Introduction  
In the rush of daily life, we often underestimate the profound influence of something as simple as breathing.  
Yet, our breath has the power to significantly improve both our mental and physical health.  

Belly breathing, also known as abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing, is a technique that encourages deep, full breaths using the diaphragm, unlike the shallow, restrictive nature of chest breathing.  

This method allows the lungs to fully expand, promoting relaxation, reducing stress, and supporting overall well-being.  

By focusing on effective breathing, we can enhance our wellness in ways that are both accessible and impactful.

## Need for the Study  
- Many people struggle to practice **belly breathing correctly**.  
- Existing tools to monitor and improve breathing are either **costly** or **lack real-time feedback**.  
- A simple, affordable, and **user-friendly device** is needed to provide **immediate visual feedback** on chest vs. belly breathing.  
- This will help individuals **optimize their breathing technique** for better **respiratory health, stress management, and fitness**.  

---

## Hypothesis  
Individuals using a **real-time, Arduino-based device** that monitors and visually displays chest and belly breathing patterns will show an improvement in their breathing technique, **increasing the proportion of belly breathing** and reducing chest breathing over time.  

---

## Aim  
To measure the relative amount of **belly breathing** and **chest breathing** through the **blinking of an LED** for overall wellness.  

---

## Objective  
To create an **affordable** device that helps people improve their breathing by **showing them real-time feedback** on how they are breathing.

## Conclusion  
- The device successfully **monitors and distinguishes** between chest and belly breathing.  
- **Real-time LED feedback** helps users **improve their breathing techniques**.  
- The system has been built and calibrated, showing **accurate results**.  
- Future work will focus on **enhancing usability, portability, and scalability**.

## Future Prospects  
- **Add data tracking and analysis** via mobile apps or wireless features.  
- **Explore medical applications** in respiratory therapy and fitness training.  
- **Adapt the device for stress management** through real-time breath monitoring.  
- **Conduct long-term studies** on the impact of consistent use on health, mood, and stress.
